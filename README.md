## Description

Push-Swap is a project designed to implement a sorting algorithm using two stacks. The goal is to sort a list of integers with the least number of operations possible. This project is part of the 42 curriculum and aims to enhance your understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- Efficient sorting algorithm using stack operations.
- Implementation of various operations: push, rotate, reverse rotate, and swap.
- Ability to handle large datasets with optimal performance.

## Installation

To get started with Push-Swap, clone the repository and compile the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/push-swap.git
cd push-swap
make
```

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed, including the `libft` library, which is included in the project.

## Usage

To use the Push-Swap program, run the executable with a list of integers as arguments:

```bash
./push_swap 3 2 1
```

The program will output the sequence of operations needed to sort the numbers.

## Example

```bash
$ ./push_swap 3 2 1
ra
ra
```
